Hi my name is Victor and you have found the About Me page (you probably ended here by mistake) but wait...don't go, please continue.

I'm a software engineer who loves to learn new things and also who really likes video games (geeky!!). This is my first time blogging and I'm really excited and hopeful that there is something in this blog that you will find useful, in this blog I will do my best share my experiences with code with all the different things I have learned combined with my geeky passions (video games, movies, series, legos and more).

I think that if we are able to mix things we want to learn with things we really like its easier to learn, at least that's the way I learn and the way I found easier for me to get develop my skillsets.

Finally *Thank you* for taking the time to be here and I hope you enjoy the content and you find something useful from the blog (at least some good games, yeah!!).
