## A long time ago in a blog far far away...*GamesCode*

Hi I'm Victor, welcome to GameCode, if this is your first time here you probably will find this place a little different since there are 2 topics that I will consistently write **Code and Video Games**. The main difference is that although everyone likes "real life" examples 
of a programming language or coding technique, IMHO I have found that "real life" examples sometimes can be, tedious, boring and for some of us like **me** harder to learn; in an effort spice it up I've mixed coding with my other passions (video games, movies, series yay!!).
I have found if I do this it makes my learning more valueable, meaningful and less forgetful. 

I hope the content you find in this blog it's helpful for you or at least fun and that you can take it mix it with your passions to build or try something new.
